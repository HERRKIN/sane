## Quickstart
* `npm install -g sails sane-cli`
* `sane new project --docker` creates project with [sails-disk](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-disk) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). For production databases see [Options](#sane-stack-cli-options).
* `sane generate resource user name:string age:number` to generate a new API on the backend and models on the frontend
* `sane up` to start the sails server on `localhost:1337` as well as the ember dev server on `localhost:4200`.
* To work on your frontend-app you work as you would normally do with ember-cli on `localhost:4200`.
* You are now good to go.

**Note: If you use Docker, make sure you have [compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed. On Mac or Windows also [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/) and for Linux see: [https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/)**

## Overview

* The cli creates a sane folder structure so you can develop server and client seperately, but they integrate smoothly.
* Sets up your SailsJS project either locally or with a [sails-container](https://github.com/artificialio/docker-sails) and a database of choice (sails-disk, mongoDB, MySQL or Postgres) using [compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/) to provide an isolated development environment that can be used in production.
* Using the [ember-cli](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli) you have globally installed to set up an ember-frontend in a `client` sub-folder.

To find out more about Sails and Ember and how they work together, you can take a look at my talk
[http://vimeo.com/103711300](http://vimeo.com/103711300) and slides [http://talks.artificial.io/sailing-with-ember/
](http://talks.artificial.io/sailing-with-ember/)

## CLI Options

`sane`

> Shows the help as well as the version of the cli.

<hr class="docs" />

`sane new project [--docker] [-d mongo|postgres|mysql|disk] [--verbose] [--skip-npm] [--skip-bower]`

> Sets up a new server/client project depending on your flags or your `.sane-cli` in your home-folder. Defaults to local setup with [sails-disk](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-disk) for quick prototyping.

`--docker` or `-D`

> Sets up your whole backend envrionment using [compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/) to provide powerful container management.

**Why Docker?** It fully automates the setup of server dependencies and you can now develop in your production environment that can be deployed to any server as-is.

`--database <option>` or `-d`, options: `mongo|postgres|mysql|disk`, default: `disk`

> Installs the right db-adapter. In combination with `--docker` automatically sets up the chosen db and connection config.

<br />
<hr class="docs" />

`sane up [--docker]`, alias: `sane serve`

> Boots up your sails server (default: localhost:1337) as well as your ember-cli server (default: localhost:4200) displaying a unified log.

<br />
<hr class="docs" />

`sane generate api|resource <name> [--pod] [attribute1:type1, attribute2:type2 ... ]`, alias: `sane g`

> Generates a 'name' resource/api on the backend as well as the frontend, optionally include attributes with the specified types. Supports sails and ember-data models types. One the backend accessible at: **localhost:1337/api/v1/names**

`--pod`

> Supports the `pod` structure for ember-cli

## Sails / Ember

Ember.js guides are accssible at http://emberjs.com/guides/ and Sails.js documentation at http://sailsjs.org/#/documentation/concepts

### Data Format
You create all your resources in singular form since Sails and Ember pluralize when needed for you. If you create a `user` resource (via `sane generate resource user`) you can access the api under `localhost:1337/api/v1/users`. To create a new Record send a POST request to this address.

```js
//POST request to localhost:1337/api/v1/users
{
  "user": {
    "name": "sane",
    "age": "500"
  }
}
```

Your Sails API and Ember App are already set up to communicate with each other in that expected standard: Ember uses it's [RESTAdapter](http://emberjs.com/guides/models/the-rest-adapter/) and Sails uses [Ember Blueprints](https://github.com/mphasize/sails-generate-ember-blueprints). If you don't plan to use websockets there is not much else you have to do on the server side; Sails is waiting for requests to come in. To get started saving your models on the frontend however, follow these simple guides: http://emberjs.com/guides/models/persisting-records/.

### Websockets

To get websocket support for your Sane App simply install https://github.com/huafu/ember-data-sails. This will turned into an addon soon. In the meantime just add the following lines to your `ApplicationAdapter`.

```js
//client/app/adapters/application.js
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.RESTAdapter.extend({
  coalesceFindRequests: true,
  namespace:            'api/v1',
  useCSRF:              true,
  defaultSerializer:    '-rest',
});
```

## Docker

Sane Stack has Docker support built-in using [compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/) for container orchestration.

### Setup
On Mac or Windows first install [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/) via https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer or https://github.com/boot2docker/windows-installer. For Linux instructions see [https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/). Then install [compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/#installation-and-set-up) based on the instructions.
Once everything is set up make sure that your `$DOCKER_HOST` environemt variable is set correctly, also on Linux.

### docker-compose.yml
That is where your containers are defined, which ports you want to forward, how you want to link the containers etc. This conviniently gets generated for you on project-creation. You can add more containers that will all automatically get installed and started through the `sane up` command.

### Port forwarding

On Mac and Windows boot2docker usually runs on an IP defined via your `$DOCKER_HOST` variable, which means your sails server would only be accessible through that defined IP. To make your contianer accessible on localhost `sane up` automatically implements this Workaround: https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/blob/master/doc/WORKAROUNDS.md#port-forwarding

## .sane-cli
A file always located in your root folder which can be used to persist parameters. For example you can use it to have `--docker` set as default for each `sane` command you run. On `sane new` it gets filled with defaults based on your flags.

You can also put a `.sane-cli` in your home-directory, so you can persist some configuration that are automatically taken for newly generated projects.

The currently supportet options are:

`apps: array` See: https://github.com/sane/sane/blob/master/lib/tasks/getAppNames.js<br>
Examples: <br>
*'client' => Expected folder-name: client* <br>
*'clientv1' => Expected folder-name: clientv1* <br>
*'admin-v1-client' => Expected folder-name: admin-v1* <br>
*'server' => Expected folder-name: server* <br>
*'server2' => Expected folder-name: server2* <br>
*'api-v1-server' => Expected folder-name: api-v1* <br>
`disableAnalytics: true|false` Used to disable the anonymous analytics.
`database: postgres|mysql|mongo` Currently not in use.  <br>
`docker: true|false` Runs all commands via [compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/) <br>
`verbose: true|false` Shows extra output on some commands <br>
`skipNpm: true|false` Only used if defined in your home-directory <br>
`skipBower: true|false ` Only used if defined in your home-directory<br>

```
//sample .sane-cli
{
  "apps": [
    "client",
    "server"
  ],
  "disableAnalytics": false,
  "database": "postgresql",
  "docker": false,
  "verbose": false,
  "skipNpm": true,
  "skipBower": true
}
```

##Deployment
**Note: This is still very much work in progress. We are planning to add an automated nginx container which will make it easy to instantly deploy the containerized app to your server.**

In the meantime find the old deployment readme (ignoring any of the possible Docker setup):

* Make sure you have `npm i -g pm2` installed on your server
* Simply clone your app on the server
* Then you can use `pm2 start app.js -- --prod` in `/server` to starts sails in production mode on port 80
* `ember build --environment=production --output-path=../server/assets/`.
   * That builds the app and copies it over to be included with Sails.
   * `pm2 restart app` so Node can pick up the latest changes

The Server is configured to serve the Ember App on all routes, apart from the `api/**` routes, so Ember itself can take full control of handling error routes, etc.

For more information on deployment and different strategies check out:

* The [Sails Documentation](http://sailsjs.org/#/documentation/concepts/Deployment) to read up about some fundamentals
* [PM2 Deploy](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2#deployment) gives you some nice command line tools to ease deployment
* [Ember-CLI Deploy](https://github.com/achambers/ember-cli-deploy) for deployment via Redis and Amazon S3
* [Hardening NodeJS](http://blog.argteam.com/coding/hardening-node-js-for-production-part-2-using-nginx-to-avoid-node-js-load/) for a proper Nginx setup

## Troubleshooting

### Installing sails npm packages
If you are using docker, currently you have to run `docker-compose run server npm install <package>` in your root folder to correctly install npm packages for your sails container.

### Linux Support
The sane-cli should mostly support linux as-is. If you use docker however, make sure that your `DOCKER_HOST` variable is set so there is an IP to connect to rather than a unix socket. `localhost` is recommended, so you can access your sails-server through `localhost:1337`.

### Giving Docker non-root access
Another issues on Linux that you might run into, is that docker requires root access. If docker is set up for you that way, sane will not work properly. So please follow the instuctions here: [docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/#giving-non-root-access](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/#giving-non-root-access)

### Docker/Compose issues
If you are on Mac/Windows, often a `boot2docker restart` can help fix issues. <br>
Otherwise you can go down the hard route and remove all your docker containers and simply set them all up again:

```sh
#Set up aliases in your .bashrc, .zshrc or config.fish
alias docker.clean='docker rm $(docker ps --no-trunc -aq)'
#deletes all your downloaded images
alias docker.cleanimages='docker rmi $(docker images --filter dangling=true --quiet)'
#in your project root folder run
docker.clean
docker.cleanimages
sane up --docker #(if it is not defaulted in your `.sane-cli`)
```

### Error: connect EHOSTUNREACH
After launching the ember server and backend via `sane up` and accessing the web application the ember server crashes with the error `Error: connect EHOSTUNREACH`.

**Solution**: <br>
Deleting and re-installing the global node modules and bower components may fix the problem
```
cd client
rm -rf bower_components node_modules
npm i && bower i
```


### Grunt error
Upon launching the server via `sane up` I get a `Fatal error: Unable to find local grunt.`

There are two possible solutions for this problem.

**Solution 1** <br>
Setup your docker containers again.
```
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm --force -v
sane up
```


**Solution 2** <br>
Start the Ember-server manually once
```
cd client
ember serve
```

wait until its loaded, then close the server.
Go back to the project root and fire up sane.
```
cd ..
sane up
```

### Error when install 3 packages globally at once
If you run `npm install -g sails sane-cli ember-cli` (*Note: Since v0.0.18 you do not need to install `ember-cli` globally anymore*) and when you try to create a new application with `sane new <app_name>` and encounter an error like this: `Cannot find module '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/sane-cli/node_modules/ember-cli/package.json'` follow these steps to fix it:

**Step 1** <br>
`npm uninstall -g sails` <br>
`npm uninstall -g ember-cli` <br>
`npm uninstall -g sane-cli` <br>

**Step 2** <br>
`npm install -g sails` <br>
`npm install -g ember-cli` <br>
`npm install -g sane-cli` <br>


## Development
This is a tool for the community, so everyone is welcome to make Sane Stack a better product. It is easy to get started:

* `git clone https://github.com/sane/sane.git`
* `cd sane && npm install` to install the dependencies
* `npm link` to make sure you can test the master version globally
* If you add a new feature also add an according unit/acceptance test based on the others
* `npm test` to run the test-suite
* Create a lovely new PR

The cli is developed with latest ES6/7 functionality, using [traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) to provide a cleaner code as well as a nice experience for us the developers. So you can also take advantage of the latest lovely features, such as `template strings`, `async/await`, etc.

## Thanks
Thanks to [mphasize](https://github.com/mphasize) for creating [sails-generate-ember-blueprints](https://github.com/mphasize/sails-generate-ember-blueprints) which overwrites the default SailsJS JSON response to the one that Ember Data's `RESTAdapter` and `RESTSerializer` expects.
